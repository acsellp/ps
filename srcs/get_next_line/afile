Before any action described below is taken, and if nbyte is zero, the read() function may detect and return errors 
as described below. In the absence of errors, or if error detection is not performed, the read() function shall 
return zero and have no other results.

On files that support seeking (for example, a regular file), the read() shall start at a position in the file 
given by the file offset associated with fildes. The file offset shall be incremented by the number of bytes 
actually read.
